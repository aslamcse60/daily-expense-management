So, this project aims to find an easier way to get rid of this problem. This project attempts to helpthe user with as much as possible the burden of manual calculation and to keep the track of the expenditure. Instead of keeping a diary or a log of the expenses for manual calculation, this website enables the user to not just keep the control on the expenses but also to find for which things the user spends more on it. 
With the help of this website, the user can manage their expenses on a daily, weekly,and monthly basis. Users can insert, modify, and delete transactions as well as can generate their reports. The result shows that Daily Expense Management will keep track the user’s expenses on day-to-day basis and it will maintain the expenses data in a secured way.
